# Project-4: Implementation of Kruskal and Prim algorithms

## Objective
Implementation of Kruskal (direct and inverse) and Prim algorithms in such a way that they calculate the minimum spanning tree, using the graph library developed in project 1.
Project 3 and project 2 fixes.


## Deliverables
In the repository, you will find:
Using the graph library developed in project 1, implement the Kruskal (direct and inverse) and Prim algorithms in such a way that they calculate the minimum spanning tree; that is, develop the methods in the Graph class:

- **Source code**
  - The Source code implementation of Kruskal (direct and inverse) and Prim algorithms:
    -       def KruskalD(self):
    -       def KruskalI(self):
    -       def Prim(self):

- **Generated Graphs Files**
  - Two for each generator (one with 30 nodes and one with 300 nodes).

- **Calculated Graphs Files**
  - Two for each generator (one with 30 nodes and one with 300 nodes).

- **Images of Visualization**
  - Images displaying the visualization of each graph (generated and calculated).
  - Screenshots showing the MST value.
